            Why not offer cheerleading skills for occasions other than sporting events? You can do cheerleading appearances at birthday parties, anniversaries, or any other occasions where someone might want to have a special surprise in store for their loved one.<br /><br />
            Car washes are usually one of the first types of fundraisers that cheerleading teams go for, and for good reasons. Gas stations are happy to help out a young cheerleading squad, and it certainly gains a lot of attention from people driving by as well.<br /><br />
            You’re only limited by your imagination, and as a cheerleading squad you can use some of that signature enthusiasm to get people interested in your fundraising cause. Now get out there and raise those funds!
