        Be sure to encourage any group members participating in your campaign to use the simple, helpful integrated email feature and to share your store’s URL across their social networks like Facebook and Twitter.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Online Donation Fundraiser</strong> - Door-to-door is one way, but when you solicit for donations online you immediately increase your reach nationwide. Our online Donation platform is flexible, fully customizable and absolutely affordable for non-profit organizations of all sizes.
        <br /><br />
        You get a @Html.ActionLink("donations-dedicated website", "DonationFundraising", "Partners") designed with your colors, images & logo, a secure donation page and the ability for your groups/chapters to register for their own donation page. Visitors will access a secure portal where they can search for groups raising funds for your cause and you can easily monitor how various groups are performing and who exactly is participating.
        <br /><br />
        Integrated Facebook, Twitter and email sharing and a tax deductible receipt issued to your donors are other amazing touches that go along with this unique fundraising idea.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Online Auctions</strong> - Virtually everyone is familiar with eBay and how it works even if they’ve never personally run an auction with them. Tap into that familiarity and put an online auction to work for your non-profit. It can be organized as either a standalone fundraising initiative or in tandem with another fundraising event. A simple Google search will produce a bevy of online auction solutions, including <a href="http://onlineauction.com" target="_blank" title="onlineauction.com">onlineauction.com</a>, <a href="http://webidz.com" target="_blank" title="webidz.com">
            webidz.com
        </a> and <a href="http://ubid.com" target="_blank" title="ubid.com">ubid.com</a> and more.

        <h3>Branding is power: Proven, customizable non-profit fundraising products</h3>
        <strong>Scratchcards</strong>
        <br />
        Though our scratchcards come in over <a href="/products/scratchcards" title="Scratchcards fundraiser">
    30 predesigned themes</a> branding them with your organization’s name and logo will make the maximum impact. Scratchcards for non-profit fundraising are a fun way to attract support: supporters scratch one or more dots and donate the amount(s) uncovered. In exchange, you tear off a coupon sheet with coupons for popular national retailers like TCBY, Pizza Hut, AMC Theatres, eMusic.com and more. Their small size makes them ideal for stashing in your purse or coat pocket so that you always have them handy.
