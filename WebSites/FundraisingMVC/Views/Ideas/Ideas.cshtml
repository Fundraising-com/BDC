         With several ecological threats looming over society, eco-friendly efforts are more critical than ever.
         Let's face it: we all need to do our part in saving the environment.
         Your supporters likely feel the same way, so harness this energy by hosting sustainable fundraisers
         <br /><br />
         <strong>Even if your nonprofit doesn't have an environment-centric mission, your team can benefit from a green fundraiser.</strong>
         You'll enhance your public image with your current donors and volunteers.
         Plus, you'll likely catch the eye of some new supporters using your eco-conscious <a href="https://www.fundraising.com/blog/post/5-fresh-fundraising">successful fundraising ideas.</a>
         <br /><br />
         When planning your next campaign, consider these eco-friendly ideas:
         <ol>
            <li>Running Shoe Drive Fundraiser</li>
            <li>Candle Fundraiser</li>
            <li>Tree Planting</li>
            <li>Sustainable Pencils Fundraiser</li>
            <li>Eco-Friendly Color Run</li>
            <li>Rummage Sale</li>
            <li>Recycling Drive</li>
            <li>Plant Sale</li>
            <li>Organic Fair</li>
         </ol>
         Donors are becoming increasingly aware of their carbon footprint. Because of this, they're much more enthusiastic about participating in eco-friendly initiatives.
         <br />
         Ready to grow your supporter base, earn some revenue, and save the Earth all at once? Let's dive in!
         <br /><br />
         <Strong>1. Running Shoe Drive Fundraiser</Strong>
         <br />
         Chances are, your donors will jump at the opportunity to clear out their closets while also supporting an eco-friendly cause.<br />
         <a href="https://sneakers4funds.com/repurpose-running-shoes/">There are a number of ways to repurpose running shoes</a>, but an athletic shoe drive fundraiser can make the largest impact by getting everyone involved. Here's how it works:.
         <br /><br />
         <ul>
            <li>Step 1: Collect gently worn, used and new running shoes with your community.</li>
            <li>Step 2: Fill the prepaid shipping bags provided by the fundraising coordinator.</li>
            <li>Step 3: Ship the bags from the nearest UPS store.</li>
            <li>Step 4: After they're processed, your check is mailed!</li>
         </ul>
         To take it a step further, turn it into a peer-to-peer fundraiser. Volunteers can collect the running shoes on your behalf,
         competing to gather the most sneakers and claim the top spot. Nothing sparks motivation quite like a friendly competition!
         <br /><br />
         For more eco-friendly ideas for athletic shoes, explore <a href="https://sneakers4funds.com/what-to-do-with-old-running-shoes/">Sneakers4Funds' guide on what to do with old running shoes.</a>


         <br /><br />
         <Strong>2. Candle Fundraiser</Strong>
         <br />
         Everyone loves a scented candle. They're great for any holiday, including Christmas, Valentine's Day, and Mother's Day, but they're likeable year round.
         <br /><br />
         When choosing your <a href="https://www.fundraising.com/products/order-takers/all-order-takers/earth-candle-brochures">Candle Fundraiser</a>, make sure the wicks burn lead-free and come in jars that you can repurpose.
         <br /><br />
         You can also <a href="https://www.fundraising.com/products/heritage-candles"> buy Heritage candles online</a> and coordinate a sale where you market them or have your volunteers sell them for you in a <a href="https://doublethedonation.com/peer-to-peer-fundraising/">
            peer-to-peer campaign
         </a>. For the best results, sell them during an upcoming holiday so that supporters can purchase their loved ones' favorite scented candles.
         <br /><br />
         Also, make sure to order several different scents. That way, you'll appeal to more supporters and ensure everyone is happy.
         <br /><br />

         <Strong>3. Tree Planting</Strong>
         <br />
         What better way is there to give back to the environment than planting trees? Coordinate your tree planting endeavor with Earth Day. Then, gather a team of volunteers and get to work.
         <br /><br />
         Commit to planting a certain number of trees in coordination with a specific fundraising amount. For instance, commit to planting 10 trees for every $500 donated.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>Chances are, volunteers or donors may be willing to lend their shovels for the occasion, so the only cost you'll need to worry about is transportation and the trees themselves.</strong>
         <br /><br />
         Line up locations in the community to plant the trees, and invite all donors to take part in the day. Encourage everyone to get involved to fight deforestation!
         <br /><br />

         <Strong>4. Sustainable Pencils Fundraiser</Strong>
         <br />
         Everyone uses writing utensils daily. Specifically, pens are one of the most popular options. Once they run out of ink, you toss them in recycling. However, recycling plastic pens isn't actually all that green. Plastic items give off toxic gasses. Even wooden pencils aren't entirely sustainable because of metal and other parts that slowly decompose.
         <br /><br />
         Instead, go with an eco-friendly option and get your followers on board. For instance, <a href="https://www.fundraising.com/products/smencils">Smencils</a> are pencils made from recycled newspapers.
         <br /><br />
         Buy in bulk and sell them to your supporters. This fundraiser will cater to any age, starting with school-aged children.
         <br /><br />

         <Strong>5. Eco-Friendly Color Run</Strong>
         <br />
         Road races are one of the most common nonprofit fundraisers and for a good reason! They get the entire community involved, raising a bunch of additional revenue.
         <br /><br />
         For an engaging theme, incorporate a splash of color. Purchase a ton of non-toxic, eco-friendly paint or chalk, and let the colors fly! Supporters of all ages will have a blast covering their friends and family with the colors of the rainbow. <strong>Best of all, you won't have to worry about cleaning up the remnants since they're biodegradable.</strong>
         <br /><br />
         Typically, walkathons involve participants taking pledges for every mile they walk from their personal networks. As for any other type of road race, charge an entry fee, and consider selling merchandise. For the best results, choose a 5K or 10K for your color run.
         <br /><br />
         Not only will you raise money, but the merchandise is a great way to spread the word about your cause. When participants wear your branded t-shirt or use your organization's water bottle, it may spark the conversation about their involvement with your nonprofit.
         <br /><br />

         <br /><br />


         <Strong>6. Rummage Sale</Strong>
         <br />
         From old clothes to unwanted electronics, everyone wants to declutter their homes. Instead of allowing these items to end up in a landfill, host a rummage sale. That way, you won't have to worry about the toxic fumes they release as they decompose.
         <br /><br />
         Typically, <a href="https://www.fundraising.com/blog/post/spring-themed-fundraising-ideas">fundraisers like this work best during springtime</a>, because donors are in the spring cleaning mindset. Encourage supporters to donate the following to your cause:
         <br /><br />
         <ul>
            <li>Unwanted clothes</li>
            <li>Usable electronics</li>
            <li>DVDs, CDs, and records</li>
            <li>Books</li>
         </ul>
         Once you've gathered all the donations, set up a pricing system. Individual pricing can dominate your team's time, so consider alternatives. For instance, use stickers to indicate prices. Green can represent $1; blue can represent $5 and so on. Then, individually price larger items such as furniture.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>Make sure to choose a visible location with plenty of parking and booth space.</strong> Rely on volunteers to staff the event, and don't forget about accepting cash donations.
         <br /><br />


         <Strong>7. Recycling Drive</Strong>
         <br />
         There are multiple ways to go about hosting a recycling drive. For one, you could encourage supporters to collect recyclable materials over a few weeks. Then, organize a drop-off date where all participants bring their reusable items. Bag the products and take them to a local recycling center. In most cases, you'll receive a certain amount of money per pound.
         <br /><br />
         On the other hand, you could organize an environmental cleanup. Gather a team of volunteers and go around the community collecting trash. For instance, go to local parks and neighborhoods. To wrap up the day, organize the trash, and separate the recyclable materials. Be on the lookout for the following:
         <br /><br />
         <ul>
            <li>Aluminum Cans</li>
            <li>Plastic/Glass Bottles</li>
            <li>Cardboard</li>
            <li>Paper</li>
         </ul>
         <br />
         Not only will this raise money, but it helps to clean up local communities, too! Best of all, it comes at no cost to your organization or its supporters.

         <br /><br />

         <Strong>8. Plant Sale</Strong>
         <br />
         Regrowing the environment is likely the greenest fundraiser you can host. Your green-thumbed supporters will love this idea, meaning you'll likely generate a lot of revenue.
         <br /><br />
         While this takes a bit of time to plan, you'll see a lot of enthusiasm from supporters. Encourage them to grow plants on your behalf. If you're running low on time, buy the plants from a local nursery. You won't produce quite as much profit compared to growing them from seeds, though.
         <br /><br />
         Consider hosting it outside in the springtime. Community members are likely starting to consider their spring and summer gardens at that time.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>From fruits and vegetables to colorful budding flowers, offer a variety of options for buyers.</strong> If possible, use biodegradable planters, too. That way, you'll have a fully-green fundraising event!
         <br /><br />


         <Strong>9. Organic Fair</Strong>
         <br />
         Highlight local green businesses with an organic fair! This is great for boosting local shopping. In other words, you'll be giving back to your community's businesses and the environment.
         <br /><br />
         Whether they sell organic products or simply have a green initiative, allow any eco-conscious business to participate. As a starting point, check into companies that sell the following products:
         <br /><br />
         <ul>
            <li>Eco-friendly cleaning products</li>
            <li>Organic foods</li>
            <li>Electric cars</li>
            <li>Solar energy products</li>
         </ul>
         <br />
         As for those with green initiatives, have them speak about their efforts to give back to the environment. It's a great opportunity for all local entrepreneurs to get the word out about their eco-friendly efforts.
         <br /><br />
         To make money through this event, sell booth space to each business. Remember to accept donations and create posters that promote your organization's text-to-give number (<a href="https://doublethedonation.com/nonprofit-software-and-resources/text-to-give-tools-for-nonprofits/">learn more here!</a>).
         Supporters will be engaged in learning about all the products and ways that can boost their positive environmental impact.
         <hr />
         As you now know, there are several ways your nonprofit can give back to the environment while still making money.
         <br /><br />
         From an effective running shoe drive fundraiser to an organic fair, get the whole community involved. Start reducing your organization's carbon footprint today!

         </a>, try to meet supporters outside a local football game, or your local sports center. If you sell <a href="/products/tumblers" title="tumblers fundraiser">
            Tumblers
         </a>, try the office or any other places where adults drink coffee.

         There is virtually no limit to the number of things you can do as a fundraiser. From competitions to raffles to games, the only limit is your imagination. To save you a little time in brainstorming we're presenting you with 105 fundraising ideas to get the ball rolling. Hopefully you'll find something you like.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>1. Deaf for a Day</strong><br />
         Assemble your finest fundraising team and collect pledges for you to pretend to be deaf for a day. On the day of deafness you can only communicate using sign language and gestures for the entire day. Not talking can be a lot harder than you think sometimes, so make sure the minimum pledge is high.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>2. Pajama Day</strong><br />
         If you work at an office, see if you can arrange a work-in-your-jammies day where everyone wishing to wear their bedclothes pays a fee for enjoying the day in the utmost of comfort. A pair of soft slippers and a terry cloth house coat could be just the thing to boost productivity and focus.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>3. Bottle Return</strong><br />
         Anytime there's a festival, concert, or show of any kind there is always garbage scattered and piling up everywhere. Offer your professional cleaning services and charge a fee for a speedy and thorough cleanup operation.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>4. Community Clean Up</strong><br />
         Anytime there's a festival, concert, or show of any kind there is always garbage scattered and piling up everywhere. Offer your professional cleaning services and charge a fee for a speedy and thorough cleanup operation.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>5. The Community Tree</strong><br />
         This works best during Christmastime. Buy the largest tree you can find and set it up in a park or neighbourhood, then sell people ornaments and lights to hang on it. Place a donations box next to the tree for people to leave their festive tidings.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>6. Ball Pit Treasure Hunt</strong><br />
         Find a large bin, something about the size of a baby's crib, and fill it with balls that have been stuffed with either prizes or "sorry try again" notes. People just reach in, dig around, and grab one. Charge $1 per try, and include a "grand prize" hidden somewhere in the mix.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>7. The Auction House</strong><br />
         Auctions always make great fundraisers, and there are several different types that you could try. There are silent auctions, blind auctions, bachelor auctions, ghost auctions, and used car auctions, just to name a few. Always make it clear that the profits from the event are going to a good cause.<br /><br />
         <strong>8. Corsages</strong><br />
         Is the local high school having prom soon? Is Valentine's Day coming up? You can make corsages fairly cheap with materials from an arts and crafts store like Michaels, or even the dollar store. Sell them at a decent markup and get the word around town.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>9. Ugly Sweater/Tie/Hat Day</strong><br />
         Ugly sweaters often pop up around the holidays, but you can stage your own ugly sweater day at the office to generate some quick and easy funds. People simple pay a nominal fee to wear an ugly sweater to work, and you could make things more interesting by offering a prize to the ugliest sweater of the day.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>10. Selling Saplings</strong><br />
         Go to a local arboretum or green house and ask if they have any saplings they would be willing to donate to your fundraising cause. Then sell the baby trees to people any way you can. Whether you do it online, door to door, or in a store there are lots of people who want to liven up their homes with a little greenery.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>11. Busking</strong><br />
         If you or anyone else on your fundraising team has a musical talent you can always try playing in the street for money. Some buskers can makes hundreds of dollars in an outing so don't underestimate this one. You might have to check with the city to see if you need to apply for a street performer's license first, however.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>12. Create a Mixtape</strong><br />
         The art of the mixtape isn't dead, it can still live on in your fundraising efforts! Going along with the busking idea, if your fundraising team has any musical talent you can record a few songs on a CD and sell them. You'll need to rent time in a studio to make a professional quality recording.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>13. Theme Party</strong><br />
         Who doesn't like going to a theme party every now and then? Pick your own wacky or exotic theme and charge your guests a modest admission. You'll have to throw in a big draw to get a lot of people interested, like a popular DJ or band.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>14. Movie Night</strong><br />
         Movie nights are a tried and true fundraising idea. You can make this extra-interesting if you hold it in the summertime by having it outdoors in a beautiful park or down by the water (if your city has water). Just be sure to pick a film that's suitable for all ages.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>15. Sports!</strong><br />
         Another great idea is to arrange a sports game; hockey, football, soccer baseball, whatever is most popular in your city, and generate revenue from ticket sales and concessions.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>16. Beat the Goalie</strong><br />
         If you have connections in professional or minor league sports, see if you can find a goaltender who would be willing to help you out. Charge people to take shots (or kicks if you want to do soccer) on the goalie and anyone who scores gets a small prize.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>17. Scavenger Hunt</strong><br />
         Make a treasure map with clues leading to a buried treasure somewhere in town and charge people a fee to play the game. Generate a buzz with social media and whatever ads you can afford. The more players, the merrier.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>18. Lawnmower Men</strong><br />
         Are your neighbours letting their grass grow a bit too long? Go door-to-door with a lawnmower and ask people if they'd like their grass cut for a fee. This idea works especially well with school kids.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>19. Can I Assist You?</strong><br />
         Offer to be someone's personal assistant for a day. Clean their shoes, fetch their coffee, and take their phone calls, all for a modest fee being put towards a good cause. A lot of people are so busy these days, why not help them out?
         <br /><br />
         <strong>20. Dog Walking Service</strong><br />
         Dogs are a lot of responsibility to own since you have to take them out for walks regularly during the day, and this can be a problem for some people who have to be at work all day. Start a dog walking service and take care of the little pooches when their owners can't be around.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>21. Mr. Fix-It</strong><br />
         - If you're handy, why not offer your know how to people in need. Even odd jobs around the house like fixing a leaky sink or patching a hole in the wall can be worth a small fee. The key is to be able to handle as many jobs as possible to maximize your revenue potential and this might entail buying new tools or watching tutorials on home repair.<br /><br />
         <strong>22. Let's Go Bowling</strong><br />
         There's nothing like the sound of 10 pins smashing after bowling a strike! A simple bowling tournament can be a great way to rally people of all ages together. Fundraising comes through player registration fees and concessions.<br /><br />
         <strong>23. Games Tourney</strong><br />
         Board games are all the rage these days, so you could easily put together a board games event in a banquet hall. This could work as a tournament or as a friendly games night where people pay to rent board games and play with their friends.<br /><br />
         <strong>24. Karaoke Idol</strong><br />
         Some people turn into rock stars once they have a few drinks and stand on a stage, so give them a place to claim their crown as Karaoke Idol. Offer a cash prize to the winner, and consolation prizes to the runners up. Make a big spectacle of this fundraiser and it will be a night to remember.<br /><br />
         <strong>25. Used Book Blowout</strong><br />
         Ask around if people have any old books they want to get rid of and sell them all in a used book blowout sidewalk sale. See if you can get a table at a bazaar or festival to get a spot with tons of foot traffic.<br /><br />
         <strong>26. TV Series Finale Marathon</strong><br />
         People often like to make a big deal of it when their favorite show reaches its terminal episode so they make an event out of it. But what about having a fundraiser where you show the series finales of a dozen or so popular television shows? Choose a diverse selection of shows to attract the biggest audience.<br /><br />
         <strong>27. Poker Tournament</strong><br />
         Poker is an intense game of skill, and some people take it very seriously. Some poker champs earn millions in tournaments. Although you might not make that much at your poker tournament fundraiser, you can still make something when the stakes get high.<br /><br />
         <strong>28. Swear Jar</strong><br />
         Does someone in your family or one of your coworkers have a bit of a potty mouth problem? Charge them $1 for every bad word they say. They will either clean up their language, or go broke from the cost.<br /><br />
         <strong>29. Dress Down Day</strong><br />
         A lot of offices might have casual Fridays' when the staff gets to wear jeans and shirts to work. It also makes for a solid fundraising idea. Charge people $5 to dress casual on any day of the week at your office.<br /><br />
         <strong>30. Benefit Show</strong><br />
         Maybe you know a band or an acting group? Ask them if they'd be willing to put on a show with all the proceeds going towards your fundraising cause. This is another fundraising event where you can sell concessions and apparel.<br /><br />
         <strong>31. Henna Tattoos</strong><br />
         Almost everyone has tattoos these days, but they're permanent so now everyone would want to get one. Henna, on the other hand, is temporary, and the elegant and intricate lines painted over the hands looks interesting. Find a henna artist willing to help you out and pay them with a cut of the proceeds.<br /><br />
         <strong>32. Street Carnival</strong><br />
         You'll have to apply for a city permit for this one, and there is a lot of paperwork involved, but carnival rides and games are easy enough to rent along with the crew to set them up. Street carnivals are a great summertime fundraising idea.<br /><br />
         <strong>33. Balloon Popping</strong><br />
         Inflate a couple hundred balloons and fill them with notes or prizes, then charge people to pop the balloons at $1 a pop, or whatever other price you choose. You can use cheap dollar store prizes, and maybe even have a grand prize hidden somewhere.<br /><br />
         <strong>34. Dance Lessons</strong><br />
         If you or someone else on your fundraising team knows how to dance, try offering dance classes to the public. Either one-on-one or group classes can work here. A few popular dance styles to go with are salsa, swing dancing, and meringue.<br /><br />
         <strong>35. Racing Day</strong><br />
         Gentlemen start your engines! See if you can rent a racetrack for a day and put on a race. Nascar or F-1? It's up to you.<br /><br />
         <strong>36. Car Smash</strong><br />
         Give people a way to take out their aggressions after a stressful day with this fundraising idea. Procure an old car and charge people for the pleasure of smashing it with a sledgehammer.<br /><br />
         <strong>37. CFL Bulb Replacement</strong><br />
         CFL bulbs are good for the environment and reduce your electricity bill, so you can do people a service by replacing their old bulbs with these newer, more efficient ones. You'll have to find a source that can sell you the bulbs for cheap to make this worth it.<br /><br />
         <strong>38. Christmas Caroling</strong><br />
         This fundraising idea is an oldie, but a goodie. Spread some Christmas cheer by going door to door and regaling people with festive tunes. The spirit of the season is sure to make some people give you a few bucks.<br /><br />
         <strong>40. Cooking Class</strong><br />
         Do you know your way around the kitchen? Host a cooking class where you teach them some of your best recipes techniques. Food has a way of bringing people together, so this fundraising idea can't miss.<br /><br />
         <strong>41. Cow Pie Bingo</strong><br />
         Here's a new take on bingo. Find a farmer who will allow you to use one of his cows and his field. Draw a large bingo board on the ground and as the cow walks around, people playing the game have to guess which square it will do its business on. If the cow pie lands of their square they get a point.<br /><br />
         <strong>42. Pet Grooming</strong><br />
         This is a great fundraising idea for pet lovers. Offer your services around your neighbourhood and beyond as a pet groomer and put all your profits towards your cause.<br /><br />
         <strong>43. Dunk Tank</strong><br />
         This fundraiser is fun for everyone, as long as you don't mind falling into a tank of cold water! Charge people $1 per throw to hit the target, and make it interesting by taunting them and putting on various antics. Make it a show and the money will roll in faster than you can say dunk!<br /><br />
         <strong>44. Guided Tours</strong><br />
         If you know where all the best spots are in your city, or if you can show people around a specific area and can explain the history behind you could be successful as a tour guide. It's a pretty easy business model, and tips are always a possibility too.<br /><br />
         <strong>45. Full Service Gas Station</strong><br />
         It seems the full service gas station went extinct a long time ago, but you can bring it back if you can find a gas station willing to let you do this. Pump gas and wash windshields for everyone who comes and be sure to make it known that you're doing it for a good cause.<br /><br />
         <strong>46. Horseback Riding</strong><br />
         How often do you get that chance to ride a horse? Probably not often at all, so see if you can set up a horseback riding course. You'll need to find access to the horses, and you'll need a venue with a simple track that people can ride on. Or, even better, do it out in the countryside where people have space to roam.<br /><br />
         <strong>47. Gourd Throwing</strong><br />
         Around Thanksgiving is when all the gourds are harvested, and there are always too many of them. From pumpkins to squash, what are we to do with all these gourds? As a fundraiser, organize a gourd throwing competition where people have to build their own throwing mechanisms like catapults or trebuchets. It'll be good and messy fun.<br /><br />
         <strong>48. Guest Speaker Seminar</strong><br />
         See if you can find an educational or motivational speaker willing to volunteer for your cause. Charge a modest admission fee for anyone wishing to attend, and generate a buzz via advertising and social media.<br /><br />
         <strong>49. Ghost Walk</strong><br />
         Most places have old ghost stories being told, so why not arrange a ghost walk tour where you introduce people to all the supernatural folklore of your city? Naturally, this fundraiser works best around Halloween.<br /><br />
         <strong>50. Head Shaving</strong><br />
         You've probably seen this one before, and that's because it works. Collect sponsors willing to pay you to shave your head. This might be a little harder to commit to if you're a woman, so make sure the minimum pledge is a relatively high number!<br /><br />
         <strong>51. Language Classes</strong><br />
         Bilingualism is a tremendously useful skill, but in North America a lot of people only know one language. Help people get started on their second, or perfect what they already know, with some language lessons. French, Spanish, and Mandarin are all popular language choices.<br /><br />
         <strong>52. Luau</strong><br />
         Get out your grass skirts and ukuleles because it's time to get Hawaiian! Some people will pay good money to enjoy a taste of tropical culture in a country where it's too cold to go outside for five months out of the year.<br /><br />
         <strong>53. Luxury Car Test Ride</strong><br />
         Some people would do almost anything for the chance to drive a Lamborghini or Ferrari, so why not give them the chance? There are many luxury car dealerships that will allow you to rent a car for a day, so take it to a track and charge people top dollar to ride around the course once<br /><br />
         <strong>54. Sexy Calendar</strong><br />
         We all know how popular fireman calendars are, so how about making your own sexy calendar as a fundraiser? On the flip side, you could make it something silly instead if sexy doesn't seem appropriate.<br /><br />
         <strong>55. Pop-Up Garden</strong><br />
         This is another small business idea. Imagine waking up to find your front lawn covered in pink flamingos! What a surprise it would be. That's exactly what this business would do. Overnight, set up a display of plastic animals or plants to amaze the lucky recipient.<br /><br />
         <strong>56. Pancakes</strong><br />
         Who doesn't like pancakes? They're cheap and easy to make, so as a fundraiser you can charge people on per pancake basis. Plus, you can offer toppings like fruits and nuts which they can add for an additional fee.<br /><br />
         <strong>57. No Pants Day</strong><br />
         The annual No Pants Subway Ride is becoming a phenomenon, so you can channel that same thing in your fundraising efforts. Look for sponsors willing to pay you to go a whole day with no pants on. Offer to show them photos as proof when you are ready to pantsless.<br /><br />
         <strong>58. T-Shirt Sale</strong><br />
         Pretty much everyone wear T-shirts and there are funds to be raised here. Procure a few hundred plain t-shirts in various colours and a silk screen printer. Set up a booth where you can make custom printed t-shirts. Even at just $10 each you can make a killing.<br /><br />
         <strong>59. Plinko</strong><br />
         This game fits in well at a festival or carnival. Set up a giant plinko board (the game they had on The Price is Right) and charge people to drop wooden pucks down the board. Offer prizes to people who hit the right slots.<br /><br />
         <strong>60. Santa Claus</strong><br />
         It's time to start practising your jolly ho ho ho's because if its Christmas time you can raise some serious funds this way. Set up a Santa's Workshop at a local mall and hire a few helper elves. Every kid wants their picture taken with Santa and the funds will roll in faster than you can say Merry Christmas.<br /><br />
         <strong>61. Raking Leaves</strong><br />
         Raking and bagging the leaves in the yard can be a painstaking and time consuming task, but that's exactly why you can make money doing it. Go around your neighbourhood with a rake and a pack of yard waste bags and see who will pay you to clean their yard.<br /><br />
         <strong>62. Scramble Golf</strong><br />
         In this style of golf all four players tee off at once and then shoot from the ball that lands closest to the hole. This continues until they get to the green, and then they all put from where the ball closest to the hole is. It's easier and more fun than regular golf, so you should be able to get a lot of people interested in this fundraiser.<br /><br />
         <strong>63. Celebrity Bartenders</strong><br />
         Host a bar night with celebrity bartenders and charge top dollar for entry. Hire flair bartenders (the kind that know how to do crazy tricks) and make the event a night to remember. Just add music and dancing and you'll have tons of funds by the end of the night.<br /><br />
         <strong>64. Smoothie Bar</strong><br />
         For the more health conscious consumers, you can have a smoothie bar offering a menu of various tropic delights. You'll need to procure various fruits like banana, strawberry, kiwi, and mango, at wholesale price to make this worthwhile.<br /><br />
         <strong>65. Ice Cream Vendor</strong><br />
         There's nothing better than an ice cold treat on a sweltering hot day. Acquire large amount of ice cream bars and popsicles on the cheap and sell them at outdoor events and city parks. You might need to apply for a vendor license first to do this legally though.<br /><br />
         <strong>66. Revenge on the Boss/Teacher</strong><br />
         Ask your boss or teacher if they would be willing to be subject to a harmless revenge prank for charity. It could just be something fun and simple like a cream pie in the face, but it shouldn't be anything embarrassing or harmful.<br /><br />
         <strong>67. Tug-o-War</strong><br />
         Heave! Ho! A tug of war is a great way to bring the community together, and as a fundraiser no matter who wins money will go to charity. This is another great chance to look for sponsors willing to lend some money to the cause.<br /><br />
         <strong>68. Junk Car Rally</strong><br />
         A little demolition derby is sure to get your blood pumping, so see if anyone has an old clunker they would be willing to enter into a junk car rally race. Charge the drivers an entry fee, and charge spectators admission. Concessions and memorabilia are some additional revenue streams here.<br /><br />
         <strong>69. Bake-to-Order</strong><br />
         This is a different take on the traditional bake sale fundraiser. Present people with a menu of possible items you can bake and take their orders. Maybe you could even offer bulk discounts to attract some big sales.<br /><br />
         <strong>70. Dueling Pianos</strong><br />
         Gambling is a sure way to raise some funds and you can arrange to put on your own casino night. Hire some pro card dealers and rent the blackjack tables, slot machines, poker tables, and craps tables. Don't forget; the house always wins.<br /><br />
         <strong>71. Wine Tasting</strong><br />
         If you're the athletic type, make an announcement that you'll be making a long and hard journey biking, running, or swimming, and look for sponsors. Many people might be inspired with the difficult task you're taking on and gladly throw money at you.<br /><br />
         <strong>72. Casino Night</strong><br />
         Gambling is a sure way to raise some funds and you can arrange to put on your own casino night. Hire some pro card dealers and rent the blackjack tables, slot machines, poker tables, and craps tables. Don't forget; the house always wins.<br /><br />
         <strong>73. Sponsored Bike Ride/Run/Swim</strong><br />
         If you're the athletic type, make an announcement that you'll be making a long and hard journey biking, running, or swimming, and look for sponsors. Many people might be inspired with the difficult task you're taking on and gladly throw money at you.<br /><br />
         <strong>74. Duck Regata</strong><br />
         You've heard of a sailing regatta, but have you ever heard of a duck regatta? Have people each buy rubber ducks and let them float down the river. May the fastest duck win!<br /><br />
         <strong>75. House Sitting</strong><br />
         Do you know anyone who's going on a vacation and needs someone to look after their place while they're gone? Offer your services as a house sitter and charge a fee to put towards your fundraising efforts<br /><br />
         <strong>76. Baby Sitting</strong><br />
         Maybe you have a friend or relative with a child and they're having trouble finding someone reliable to take care of them? If you're good with kids this can be an easy fundraising idea to pull off.<br /><br />
         <strong>77. Talent Show</strong><br />
         This tried and true fundraising idea can work very well if you get the word out in advance that you're putting on a show for charity. People of all talents are welcome, and you can start a buzz over social media and with ads in your local paper or radio station.<br /><br />
         <strong>78. Serenade in the Park</strong><br />
         If you have some musical talent try playing songs for people in the park or in restaurants, always telling them that you're doing this as a fundraiser so any tips are well appreciated. Brighten someone's evening with a beautiful song!<br /><br />
         <strong>79. Sell Flowers</strong><br />
         If you can find a florist or greenhouse that can give some roses at a wholesale price, walk around town in the areas where a lot of couples tend to go on dates and see if you can talk the gentlemen into buying flowers for their ladies. It'll make them look good, and it'll raise funds for your cause.<br /><br />
         <strong>80. Portrait Booth</strong><br />
         If you have some artistic talent, set up a booth where you draw people's portraits for a fee. This fundraising idea works especially well in the more touristy areas of town.<br /><br />
         <strong>81. Poetry Booth</strong><br />
         Revive the underappreciated art of poetry with this fundraising idea! Just like the portrait booth, write a poem on the spot for people willing to pay a fee. Print it out on an elegant sheet of paper so they have something to take home.<br /><br />
         <strong>82. Make Your Own Pizza</strong><br />
         Pizza fundraisers are common, but why not allow people the ability to make their own pizza? Set up a table with all the dough, sauce and fixings you need, and have a piping hot pizza oven at the end.<br /><br />
         <strong>83. Dance-a-thon</strong><br />
         With this fundraiser you can literally dance the night away. Collect money from sponsors willing to pay you to dance all night long. The more people you get involved in this dance marathon, the more funds you can raise.<br /><br />
         <strong>84. Knitted Goods</strong><br />
         If you know how to knit, some people might pay good money to purchase some hand-crafted mittens, sweaters, and scarves. This fundraiser might be most effective in the winter time when people need to stock up on warm clothing.<br /><br />
         <strong>85. Homemade Preserves</strong><br />
         A lot of people like to know that the food they're eating is healthy and natural, so you can raise some funds by selling your own homemade preserves. Things like jams and spreads are sure to be hot sellers.<br /><br />
         <strong>86. Pet Show</strong><br />
         Put on a pet show for the community. Have them do tricks and stunts to amuse the crowd, or have a beauty competition for pets. A lot of people love cats and dogs, so this can be a lot of fun for everyone involved.<br /><br />
         <strong>87. Go Kart Race</strong><br />
         See if you can rent a go kart track for a day and make an event out of it where anyone can enter. Set it up as a tournament, or a long race, and this will be a fun day at the track.<br /><br />
         <strong>88. Scratchcards</strong><br />
         Some people get addicted to scratch and win tickets, but you can make your own scratchcards and sell them at a similar price. With your cards the prizes won't be near as lofty though.<br /><br />
         <strong>89. Photo Competition</strong><br />
         Ask everyone to bring out their inner shutterbug and put on a photography competition. People must pay a small fee per photo they enter in the contest, and the top three winners get modest prizes.<br /><br />
         <strong>90. Sell Candles</strong><br />
         Candles are cheap if you buy them wholesale, but they are also pretty easy to make from scratch. Either way, this is another product that you could make a small business out of to raise some quick funds.<br /><br />
         <strong>91. Rat Race</strong><br />
         Life in the big city is a rat race, so people will love this as it is an actually race with rats scurrying through a maze. Have each rat wear a number and take bets on who will win.<br /><br />
         <strong>92. Junk Removal</strong><br />
         Lots of people have loads of old junk they don't know what to do with, and there is big money in junk removal services. Get a truck and a couple strong people to help out and you can clean up both literally, and figuratively.<br /><br />
         <strong>93. Community Mural</strong><br />
         Nothing jazzes up a neighbourhood like street art, and you can do it in your area with a community mural. Get city approval to cover a wall with outdoor art and charge people to add their own creations to it.<br /><br />
         <strong>94. Art Exhibit</strong><br />
         If you have connections into the art world, this can be a great fundraising idea. Stage an art exhibit for charity and take a small cut of all artwork sold for your fundraiser.<br /><br />
         <strong>95. Abseil Down a Building</strong><br />
         Also known as rappelling is perfect for getting media attention and generating a buzz. Collect sponsors for this one and choose the biggest, tallest, most well known building in your city to abseil down it. It's very important that the setup is done by professionals in order to ensure a secure environment.<br /><br />
         <strong>96. Beard Growing Competition</strong><br />
         Beards are trendy these days, so any guy who can grow one can consider doing it as a fundraising idea. Collect sponsors willing to see you or your fundraising partners with a full beard, and then collect sponsors again in a few months to shave it off!<br /><br />
         <strong>97. BMX/Skateboard Show</strong><br />
         It's exhilarating watching people do crazy stunts on BMXs ad skateboards, so this is another fun fundraising event to atend. Hire some pro skaters and BMXers and arrange a show in your town.<br /><br />
         <strong>98. Egg Drop</strong><br />
         Just like the art exhibit, this is a fun and engaging way to get people out to support your fundraising cause. You'll need some connections into the industry and a good venue to make it happen.<br /><br />
         <strong>99. Fashion Show</strong><br />
         Just like the art exhibit, this is a fun and engaging way to get people out to support your fundraising cause. You'll need some connections into the industry and a good venue to make it happen.<br /><br />
         <strong>100. Quit a Vice</strong><br />
         If you're a smoker or a drinker, it's time to quit that nasty habit and raise some funds while you're at it. Just look for sponsors willing to see you quit your old habit. The hard thing is the actual quitting part.<br /><br />
         <strong>101. Kite Fighting</strong><br />
         We all know about kite flying, but what about kite fighting? It's where people fly their kites and have them "attack" one another by colliding. Charge people to play in the competition.<br /><br />
         <strong>102. Murder Mystery</strong><br />
         Host a dinner party with a twist; there's been a murder and they have to solve it through various clues that pop up throughout the night. Charge people entry to this special event.<br /><br />
         <strong>103. Obstacle Course</strong><br />
         This fundraiser is fun for people both young and old. Set up an obstacle course and charge people for the pleasure of running through it. This goes well at a carnival or street festival.<br /><br />
         <strong>104. Parachuting</strong><br />
         Just like the abseiling idea, this one is great for adrenaline junkies and easily lends itself to media coverage. How many people would pay to see you jump out of a plane? Hopefully a lot!<br /><br />
         <strong>105. In Stocks</strong><br />
         If you, or someone on your team, doesn't mind suffering for the cause, put them in stocks and have people pay to throw things like water balloons or banana cream pies at them. This fundraising activity is another good one for carnivals and street festivals.<br /><br />

   <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12">
         <strong>A is for All You Can Eat</strong><br />
         Who doesn't like to eat? More than that, who can resist the chance to eat all they can cram into their stomachs for a low price? Try offering an all you can eat buffet of some type of food that lots of people enjoy. Some good options for this might be pizza, Chinese food, hotdogs, or miniature hamburgers. Pretty much any delicious food that you can get in bulk might do the job here, and you can pull people from miles around if you have it in a fun outdoor location like a city park. If you plan on having it outdoors, be sure to have a backup plan in case of rain.

         <strong>B is for Brazilian</strong><br />
         Put on your dancing shoes! Rent out a music hall and change a small admission for people to come in and dance the night away. You can make this even more unique by adding a special theme like 80s disco, or 70s rock n' roll. Not only can you generate revenue from admissions, but also from selling drinks and snacks. You'll of course have to account for the cost of hiring a DJ or bands, the venue rental, and any other costs that come with it, but in the end you should be able to turn a profit. Do the math first to see what your breakeven point will be and figure out how feasible it will be to raise your desired amount of funds.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>C is for Cook-a-thon</strong><br />
         Again on the theme of food, you can set up a cook-a-thon where people come out and cook whatever they want and you sell whatever they make. This can get interesting as you never know what people are going to come up with, so you might end up with is a cornucopia of culinary delights. If you're doing it in the summertime, barbequing is the way to go, and be sure to offer ice cold refreshments as well. Good food has a way of bringing people together, and that's exactly what you want to do when throwing a fundraiser.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>D is for Dance Party</strong><br />
         Put on your dancing shoes! Rent out a music hall and change a small admission for people to come in and dance the night away. You can make this even more unique by adding a special theme like 80s disco, or 70s rock n' roll. Not only can you generate revenue from admissions, but also from selling drinks and snacks.

Do the math first to see what your breakeven point will be and figure out how feasible it will be to raise your desired amount of funds.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>E is for Environmental Cleanup</strong><br />
         Do some good for your community and assemble a team to clean up a local park, forest, or river. You'll be doing a great service to the neighbourhood, and people will appreciate the hard work you're doing. The way to make money here is to get sponsored by local residents and businesses. Go door to door, or ask around online, and get as many pledges as you can. The more people you have looking for pledges the better, and it also helps to plan on cleaning up an area that really needs it.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>F is for Film Night</strong><br />
         Almost anyone likes maxing and relaxing with a good movie, so this can make for a simple fundraising idea. Stage it outside if the weather's nice and make like a sit down drive in theatre, or host it at a community centre on the cheap. The money comes from admission fees and concessions, just like a real movie theatre, and you can get popcorn and refreshment for cheap from a dollar store. Just be sure to pick a film that's okay for all ages.
         <br /><br />

   <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12">
         <strong>G is for Games Tournament</strong><br />
         There has been a massive resurgence in the popularity of  board games, so this presents another great fundraising opportunity. Choose a competitive game and get the word out that you're having a tournament with a small sign up fee, and prizes for the winners. It shouldn't be too hard to get people interested in this idea. It'll be fun night of games for everyone, and you can also offer snacks and drinks as an additional revenue stream.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>H is for Hockey</strong><br />
         Few things are as Canadian as hockey, so better way to get people to come out and show their support for your cause then by staging a hockey game? There are a couple ways you can do this. You can either have people pay to join a team and play in either a tournament or a single match against other participants, or you can set up a game with local players and charge admission.  Getting local celebrities to show up can help attract more attention to the game. Either way, keep things light and friendly because like Stompin' Tom Connors said, "The best game you can name is a good old hockey game!"
         <br /><br />
         <strong>I is for Icy Water</strong><br />
         Every January, some people (who might be crazy) partake in the polar bear swim, which is where they plunge headlong into the frigid waters of one of the great lakes. This can also be great fundraising idea. If you or any of your partners are willing to do it, collect donations to take a dip in a freezing cold lake. You will of course want to set a minimum total donation for this, and you can make a big event out of it when you're ready to take the plunge. The best part about it is that there really are no overhead costs as you don't have to pay to jump in a lake.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>J is for Junk Sale</strong><br />
         More commonly called a garage sale, this is an easy way to raise a little money and get rid of any old stuff you have lying around at the same time. If you want to get other people involved, you can charge them a nominal fee to set up their own table at the event. Stage this in an area that gets a lot of foot traffic to maximize the number of potential customers, and send out some flyers around town to get the word out before the big day. Social media is also very useful in raising some awareness of your junk sale, so set up a Facebook event and promote it as much as possible leading up to the day.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>K is for Karaoke</strong><br />
         How low can you go? Host a limbo competition and find out! This is a great summertime fundraiser that of course lends itself to Caribbean themes. Get someone to play a steel drum and a booth where people can buy fresh coconuts, and it'll be just like Jamaica. When the music's playing and the bar comes down lower and lower there will be an intoxicating energy in the air.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>L is for Limbo</strong><br />
         How low can you go? Host a limbo competition and find out! This is a great summertime fundraiser that of course lends itself to Caribbean themes. Get someone to play a steel drum and a booth where people can buy fresh coconuts, and it'll be just like Jamaica. When the music's playing and the bar comes down lower and lower there will be an intoxicating energy in the air.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>M is for Marathon</strong><br />
         This option isn't for the faint of heart. It takes serious endurance to run a marathon, so you might just want to do a half marathon, but either way this is a solid fundraising idea. Have every person on your fundraising team look for sponsors to run a marathon and the money will add up quick. You might want to do a little training before hand though. It's sure to take a lot out of you, but it'll be worth it when you hit your fundraising goal.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>N is for Nature</strong><br />
         Maybe you live in a city with a lot of scenic trails and parks? Try arranging guided hikes around some of the most breathtaking areas and providing people with information on some of your cities best natural settings. Most cities do have natural beauty to be found, you just have to know where to look, so you can surprise people by showing where the good stuff is. For this you would charge a fee, and tips are also a possibility if you give good service.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>O is for Origami</strong><br />
         The Japanese art of paper folding is rare skill. It take a lot of patience and precision to make one of those little paper cranes or frogs, and that make for interesting knick knacks to have on your desk at the office or bookshelf at home. Find some people who know how and hire them to sit at a booth and make origami animals for people at a few bucks each. It isn't everyday you see someone who can do this, so you might be able to get a lot attention from passers-by on the street when they see what's going on.

      <div class="col-md-7">
         <strong>P is for Pants</strong><br />
         Or, rather, the lack of them! You've maybe heard of the no pants subway ride which happens in major cities once a year, and this is a similar thing. You'll have to look for sponsors to pledge money to the cause with this one. The idea is that once you've raised enough money you and your partners will spend one whole day without wearing pants, wherever you go. This could be a little difficult in the wintertime, so we suggest keeping this one to the warmer months of the year.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>Q is for Quiz Night</strong><br />
         Quizzes and trivia nights are popular at bars, so if you've ever been to one you know how fun it can be. Stage your own quiz night at a popular venue and watch the money roll in. To generate some extra chance, offer bonus questions where anyone in the room can shout out an answer but if they get it wrong they have to contribute a quarter into the pot. Do this with some really tough questions and watch the change pile up. It'll look like you raided a piggy bank by the end of the night.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>R is Rap Battle</strong><br />
         This one's a great way to get younger people involved. Put the word out that you're staging a rap battle tournament where anyone can come and test their verbal mettle. You might be surprised at how many amateur rappers there are out there. Since you would host this is a concert hall or some other indoor venue, you can generate additional funds by selling snacks and refreshments. Alcoholic beverages might be ideal here, so look into getting a liquor license for the evening.
         <br /><br />

   <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12">
         <strong>S is for Shakespeare</strong><br />
         Channel your inner dramatist and act out one of Shakespeare's plays. Try going with one of the comedies as they are more suitable for all ages. If you choose to do this yourself with your business partners, we recommend going with the sponsorship route as to put on the show since you probably don't have professional acting skills and it might be a little nerve wracking to get on stage. The other route is by hiring a stage acting crew, renting a nice venue, and charging guests a modest fee to get in the door. Be sure to offer refreshments at intermissions too.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>T is for Training Seminars</strong><br />
         If you or someone in your company has a special line of expertise, ask them if they would be willing to give training sessions. It could be anything from yoga, to motivational speaking, to marketing; pretty much anything that you think people will pay to learn more about could be offered as a training session to raise money for your business. Get the word out through social media and digital advertising to generate some buzz before the event, and give people a small discount on ticket prices when they pay in advance.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>U is for Ugly Face</strong><br />
         Encourage people to get a little silly and show you their best ugly face. Have people pay to enter photos of themselves making their most hideous ugly face and assemble a panel of judges with your staff and have a good laugh at all the ridiculous pictures that come in. The winner gets a prize. May the ugliest face win!
         <br /><br />
         <strong>V is for Volleyball</strong><br />
         Another sports-themed event, this one can't miss in the summertime. Arrange a volleyball tournament and have people pay to enter, or you can hire celebrity teams and charge people tickets to watch the big game. Either way, it shouldn't be hard to generate some buzz and get people interested.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>W is for Water Fight</strong><br />
         Who doesn't love a good water fight on a blazing hot day? Get in touch with your inner child and sell people water balloons to throw at each other. Maybe you could also set up games where two teams are pitted against each other and whoever is dryer at the end of it wins.
         <br /><br />

   <div class="row">

      <div class="col-md-7">
         <strong>X is for X Marks the Spot</strong><br />
         Let's hunt for treasure! Design a map that makes people feel like their searching for pirate gold and charge them a small fee to partake in the event. Make this a day-long event where finding one treasure gives them a clue leading to the next, and the next, ultimately sending them all over town, or maybe just a large park that would be a good fit for the event. As far as what you should use for buried treasure is concerned, the dollar store should have some cheap toys that work for this purpose.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>Y is for Yoyo</strong><br />
         How many people know how to do tricks with a yoyo? Get some yoyo pros together and put on a show or a competition and charge people admission to watch. Like with any other event, food and drinks are another way you can generate some extra revenue with this fundraising idea.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>Z is for Zoo</strong><br />
         Here's an idea that the kids are sure to love, and if they kids love it they will bring the parents with them. Set up a petting zoo with barn yard animals, or whatever other exotics mammals and birds you can gather. It's not every day you get to come back to face with a sheep or an alpaca, and they are very furry and tame creatures. You'll also want to have a few animal handlers around just in case they get a little unruly from all the human attention they are sure to get.

      </div>
      <div class="col-md-7">
         Good fundraising has to do with good storytelling. If you can't tell a persuasive fundraising story, then you will have trouble meeting your goals. There are some key concepts to keep in mind when telling your fundraising story, and these can all be applied whether you're promoting a sport tournament for charity, or if you're doing a simple product fundraiser like selling <a href="https://www.fundraising.com/products/chocolate/kathryn-beich/kathryn-Beich-katydids-Tin">Katydids</a> to help people in your community.
         <br /><br />
         <Strong>Keep in Mind Why your Fundraiser Matters</Strong><br />
         First and foremost, you have to clearly communicate why your fundraising cause matters. Why is it so important that this money is raised? Why is it important for you to be involved in it? Why should the greater community care about it?
         <br /><br />
         For example, say you're raising money for a local Church group so they can clean up and revitalize a rundown city park. You could say it's important because it will improve the lives of the people living in the area. Explaining in simple terms why your fundraiser is needed right now should be the first element of your fundraising story.

      <div class="col-md-12">
         <Strong>It's All About the People</Strong>
         <br />
         It's great that you're making the commitment to fundraise for a good cause, but at the end of the day it isn't about you. The fundraiser should be about the people you're helping, and the donors that make it all possible.<br /><br />
         It can be tempting to want to start throwing numbers and statistics around, but that rarely helps support your case because people can get skeptical when they have numbers thrown at them. It's more helpful to focus on the people involved, why they need help, and what your donors can do for them.
         <br /><br />
         <Strong>Why your Donors Matter</Strong>
         <br />
         While you are doing important work with your fundraiser, you shouldn't make it seem like you're the hero here. Your fundraiser would be nothing without your supporters, so you need to tell your story from the angle of them being the real heroes. Explain what their donations will go towards to demonstrate how they will make a real difference.<br /><br />
         When you write out your fundraising story, watch out for third-person words "we" and "us". Focus on using the second person "you" to put the focus on your donors. Whether you're hosting a grand event, or if you're just selling <a href="https://www.fundraising.com/products/chocolate/kathryn-beich/kathryn-Beich-katydids-Tin">Katydids</a>, a good fundraising story is essential. Write your story down with these tips in mind and we're sure you'll improve your results and become the fundraising superhero you always wanted to be.

         No matter what kind of a fundraiser you're planning, you need to have a persuasive pitch prepared. You should be able to explain in under a minute what your fundraising idea is, and why it matters. It should be an elevator pitch; something short enough that you could tell it to someone in a quick elevator ride. But how do you pack all the necessary information into it?

         <strong>Practice Makes Perfect</strong>
         <br />
         Before you go into the world with your fundraising materials in hand, you'll need to practice your pitch until you have it down pat. Write it down, and recite it in front of a mirror until you have memorized it. Deliver your pitch to family and friends and see how they react. Ask them for feedback so you can determine ways to improve it. Your fundraising pitch will sound natural and more convincing once you've nailed it.
         <br /> <br />
         <strong>Don't Stick to the Same Script</strong>
         <br />
         Even though you've perfected your pitch, that doesn't mean you should stick to the script like a robot. Every prospective supporter is different, and each person will have their own rebuttals and responses. They may interrupt you halfway through with questions or concerns, or they may wait until the end to bombard you with questions. Through practicing your pitch on your family and friends you can figure out what the most common responses are, and you can devise the best way to respond to them.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>Demonstrate Value and Importance</strong>
         <br />
         The most important element of your pitch is in the way you explain why your fundraiser matters, and why you need help.  If you're selling cookie dough for a local elementary school fundraiser, for example, you can explain that the funds will go towards buying new computers for the school library, or for buying new equipment for the football team. When your supporters see that the fundraiser is for a good cause, and that they can make a difference in their local community, it could give them the nudge they need to pledge their support.
         <br /><br />
         Do you have your fundraising pitch ready? Be sure to apply these three tips to make it as effective as possible. While you're at it why not take a look at our selection of cookie dough? Selling these in a fundraising pitch is so easy, they practically sell themselves.

         Teachers are the life blood of any school, so getting them involved in your school fundraiser is essential for success. Whether it's a sport-themed fundraiser, a yard sale, a book drive, or a bake sale, having the teaching staff involved always helps because they have close relationships with their students, and their students' parents. Here are three tips to help you get teachers involved in school fundraisers.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>Brief Them on Your Fundraiser</strong>
         <br />
         You'll have to tell the student body about your fundraiser, and you'll need to tell the teaching staff about it too. Call a meeting where all the teachers are invited and display enthusiasm at having them involved. You'll need to explain the details of what you're doing, why it matters, and how they can help. In the end you'll want to make them feel appreciated and needed by outlining exactly what they can do to make your school fundraiser a success.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>Allow Teachers to Get Involved </strong>
         <br />
         If you give teachers a way to be involved in the fundraiser, it's a safe bet that many of them will gladly join in. If it's a sports-themed fundraiser you can assign some of the teachers to act as referees or judges. You could also have some of them help with setting up the event, and with cleaning up after the event is done. You could further incentivize the teaching staff with rewards for those who show outstanding commitment, or to the teacher whose class raised the most money.
         <br /><br />
      </div>
   </div>
   <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12">
         <strong>Host a Teacher Competition Fundraising Event</strong>
         <br />
         You could also have teachers get involved more directly. For example, you could have them offer to shave their head for a large donation, or you could have them agree to do something silly if a big enough donation is made, such as wear a costume for a day. A dunk tank is another classic fundraising idea that can be fun for everyone. Just imagine how many students will line up to dunk their teacher into a pool of cold water!
         <br /><br />
         Sports-themed fundraisers like soccer games, hockey tournaments, and football games are some fun fundraising ideas that schools can use, and you'll definitely need to get teachers involved to pull it off.

         Even though online methods are popular today, face-to-face fundraising is as effective as it's ever been. In-person fundraising might even be the only method that you use especially if you're selling some of the fundraising products that we have in our store. We have a few quick tips to share with you right now to help take your face-to-face fundraising game to the next level and make more sales than ever before. Let's take a quick look at some of the essential elements of school branding, and how they can help your school fundraisers.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>Research Your Market</strong><br />
         You can't build a strong brand image if you don't know who you're marketing to. Conduct research into different student personas and parent personas and try to understand what are their preferences, concerns, and aspirations. Once you have this information, you can highlight the aspects of your school which will appeal to those qualities. Without it, you'll be working blind and developing an image that you hope works, but could backfire. Conduct surveys, and speak to students, parents, and other people in the community to glean this information.
         <br /> <br />
      </div>
   </div>
   <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-7">
         <strong>Align Your Brand With Your Audience</strong><br />
         Now that you've narrowed down who your target audience is and what they look for, you can decide what elements of your school should be highlighted in its branding message. Write a list of the most positive elements of your school, and describe how each one applies to your audience's goals. Once you've nailed that down it will become the cornerstone of your brand image.
         <br /> <br />
         <strong>Stay Consistent</strong><br />
         Branding is only effective if it's done consistently. Your school logo, color scheme, mission statement, about page, and everything else should always be the same no matter if it's on social media, a website, a newsletter, or a fundraising drive at your school. To do this, create a style guide that clearly defines your school brand, and how it's communicated in all your marketing and social media materials. The style guide should be given to anyone involved in the school's fundraising efforts.
         <br /><br />

         <br /><br />
         <strong>Listen More Than You Speak</strong><br />
         Cultivating relationships is at the heart of effective in-person fundraising, and when it comes to building strong relationships it's always important to listen to the other person and get to know what they care about. Once you understand where they're coming from and what drives them, you'll be in a much better position to make your sales pitch because you'll be able to frame it a way that aligns with their ideals.
         <br /><br />
         You should spend 75% of the time listening, and only 25% of the time speaking when you interact with a potential supporter, so whenever you're going to make a pitch take special care to let them do the talking. It will keep you from looking too aggressive. Showing curiosity in their concerns makes you seem more sympathetic, and therefore more likely to win their support.
      </div>

   </div>
   <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12">
         <strong>Project Confidence and Sincerity</strong><br />
         Projecting an air of confidence and sincerity will help you in any area of life, and this is especially true when it comes to fundraising. When you meet with your supporters maintain strong posture and positive body language, speak clearly and calmly, and smile often. A warm, genuine smile will go a long way in making your supporters feel at ease. If they feel comfortable with you they will be more likely to hear you out and pledge their support to your fundraising cause.
         <br /> <br />
         <strong>Practice, Practice, Practice!</strong><br />
         "Practice makes perfect," as the old saying goes and this applies to your fundraising pitch as well. Before you head out to meet supporters face to face, practice your pitch over and over again until you've nailed it down perfectly. Practice in front of a mirror. Practice with one of your friends or family members. Record yourself on video and see what you really look like. All these methods can help fine tune your approach and find little areas of improvement to perfect your fundraising pitch.<br /><br />
         Last of all don't forget to thank everyone you speak to, even if they don't offer their support. Maintaining a positive demeanour will keep your spirits up and carry you through to the next supporter. Have these 3 tips in mind next time you're ready to do some face-to-face fundraising and you should have better results. Best of luck!

      <div class="col-md-12">
         This one is for our friends in Canada. There are certain things that appeal to a distinctive sense of Canadian-ness, and some of these things can be adapted to launch a successful fundraiser. So if you live in the Great White North and need some ideas, here are a few Canadian fundraisers.
         <br /> <br />
         <strong>A Good Ol' Hockey Game</strong><br />
         Canadian folk hero Stompin' Tom Connors said it best in his classic song, "the best game you can name is a good old hockey game." It's our national sport, and many Canadians grew up watching Hockey Night in Canada on the CBC, cheering for their home team. If you can go through the effort of organizing a hockey tournament, or just a single game, you can create a lot of fun and excitement for your Canadian fundraiser. During the wintertime, outdoor venues are great, but even if its summer you can still rent a hockey rink for the day. Charge people a sign up fee, and sell tickets for the game. You can make a lot selling hot chocolate, coffee, tea and snacks too. Concession stands are always a good source of additional income in your fundraising events, if you need help choosing the best options for your concession stand, don't hesitate to give us a call, our Fundraising Consultants will be happy to help.

      <div class="col-md-7">
         <strong>Winter Clothing Drive</strong><br />
         Every Canadian has a complete winter wardrobe of scarves, gloves, tuques, thick socks, and long underwear. If you're caught without some of these cold weather essentials you're not going to have a good time when our famously cold winter hits! A good Canadian fundraiser could be a winter clothing drive. Ask around for people to donate any used winter clothing they don't need but that is still in good condition, setup a garage sale in your school gym, add a stand to sell some hot chocolate and rake those funds!
         <br /><br />
         <strong>Sweet Maple Treats</strong><br />
         Maple syrup is as Canadian as hockey. After all, the maple leaf is on our flag! Maple syrup is delicious, so you can try selling pancake breakfasts with real maple syrup for your Canadian fundraiser. If you've ever tasted real maple syrup you'll know that the imitation stuff at the grocery store does not compare. Syrup farms also produce a wide variety of maple syrup-based candies, so you can try buying some of them in bulk as well.

         There are two types of sales people in this world: order takers, and order makers. It might not be immediately obvious, but there's a world of difference between the two. The bottom line is that while order takers might do alright, order makers are the ones you want on your team.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>What's An Order Maker?</strong><br />
         Order makers are the highly motivated go-getters that seem to make sales no matter where you put them. They aren't afraid to push back and challenge the customer a little bit. Rather than focusing on what the customer asks for, like order takers do, they focus on what the customer needs and try to convince them to make a purchase. Order makers still know when to quit, but they are persistent and focus on long term results.

         <strong>How to Be An Order Maker</strong><br />
         Being an order maker all comes down to a handful of key traits.
         <ul>
            <li>Challenge the customer and push them a little bit outside their comfort zone. It's important to not go too far, though. If the customer truly isn't interested, it's best to leave them alone and come back later. No one likes a pushy salesperson.</li>
            <li>Know everything about the product you're selling. You need to clearly explain the features and benefits of what you're offering to interest people.</li>
            <li>Listen to your customers, ask questions, and handle objections accordingly. Be patient, and show that you have your customer's best interest in mind. Have responses ready for the common objections that people will have.</li>

   <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12">
         At schools across the country fundraising is often used to generate the money needed to pay for all sorts of things from new textbooks to computer labs. If you're in a Parent-Teacher Organization, or if you want to get more involved with fundraising at your kids' school, there are dozens upon dozens of excellent school fundraising ideas which you could put into action. In this list, we present you with 15 tried-and-true school fundraisers for your consideration. Let's start with a classic:
         <br /><br />
         <strong>Cookie Dough</strong><br />
         <a href="/products/cookie-dough" title="Cookie Dough fundraiser">Cookie dough</a> has been a fundraising go-to for a long time, and it's not hard to understand why. We have the top cookie dough brands; in different tub sizes and proportioned packages; in a variety of flavours, including Gluten Free, so there's a great option for everyone.

   <div class="row">

      <div class="col-md-7">
         <strong>Silent Auction</strong><br />
         Auctions have been used to fundraise for all sorts of causes, and they are no less effective at school. A silent auction works well there because it gives students time to consider their options, and it doesn't require you to have everyone in the school gathered at one time to place bids.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>How Many In The Candy Jar?</strong><br />
         All you need to do is get a large jar and fill it with candies like jelly beans or chocolate eggs, then allow people to make guess for a $1 each. The winner could get a prize like a <a href="/products/discount-fundraisers" title="gift card fundraiser">gift card or one of our discount cards</a> for example.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>Pizza Day</strong><br />
         Pizza is often the go-to meal for students of all ages, so a pizza day fundraiser is a sure thing. Prepare party sized pizzas and sell the slices at $1 each in the school cafeteria or front hallway and let the funds roll in. Be sure to consider vegetarian pizzas for those who can't eat meat, and no-cheese pizzas for those who are lactose intolerant.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>Grab Bags</strong><br />
         Janet Joachim raised $1.8 million for her PTA over the course of 10 years by selling grab bags. You could steal her idea and put together some grab bags of your own and sell them for $5 each. Fill them with some of our snacks, and other useful low-cost items.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>Smencils and Smens</strong><br />
         <a href="/products/smencils" title="smencils fundraiser">Smencil and smens</a> are a top seller for school fundraisers, particularly with elementary schools. These scented writing tools come in a wide range of fruity scents. Smencils branded with popular movies and superheroes are a sure hit.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>Team Jerseys</strong><br />
         Every school has a sport team, and you can take advantage of that by ordering custom printed <a href="/products/custom-sports-apparel" title="jersey fundraiser">sports jerseys</a> with your school name and logo on it. Give students a way to show their team spirit with a sport jersey fundraiser.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>Balloon Popping</strong><br />
         Here's a cheap and easy fundraiser for school. Fill hundreds of balloons and put notes inside that either award a prize, or say "Sorry try again." Allow students to pop the balloons at $1 each, or whatever you wish to charge, and let the fun begin!

         <strong>Popcorn</strong><br />
         Popcorn is also a great choice for a school fundraiser. <a href="/products/popcorn" title="popcorn fundraiser">Our popcorn</a> comes in flavours such as cheddar cheese, classic caramel, and jalapeno cheddar, and all are no-trans fat and MSG-free. Take a look at the <a href="/products/popcorn" title="popcorn fundraiser">Gourmet Popcorn page</a> to get started.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>Scratchcards</strong><br />
         With a <a href="/products/scratchcards" title="scratchcard fundraiser">scratchcard fundraiser</a> the cards tell your supporters how much to donate. Every supporter gets a sheet of coupons for popular local deals, so they get something valuable out of it no matter what. Donation amounts on the cards range from $1 to $5, a good deal for you and your supporters.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>Chocolates</strong><br />
         Whether it's Christmas, Easter, or Valentine's Day, <a href="/products/chocolate/" title="chocolate fundraiser">chocolates</a> are an effective fundraising idea for schools.

      </div>
      <div class="col-md-7">
         <strong>Relay Race</strong><br />
         A relay race is great way to generate some team spirit and get everyone involved in a fun, outdoor activity that can raise the funds your school needs. Set up an obstacle course around the school and have people form teams. Charge a small entry fee and offer prizes to the top three winners. The prizes don't have to be anything fancy, just something to get people moving.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>Dance Party</strong><br />
         Many of us have fond memories of school dance parties, so why not have one as a fundraiser? Hire a DJ, hire a caterer, and arrange a Friday night dance party in the school gymnasium. You can charge an admission fee at the door, and you could also sell food and drink at a concession stand. You'll be raising money for the school, and making memoires to last a lifetime.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>Gift Baskets</strong><br />
         Just like the grab bags fundraiser, gift baskets are a great way to raise money for your school. Make gift baskets that are relevant to the time of year, or a current holiday, and sell them in a silent auction.

      <div class="col-md-12">
         No matter the season we've got loads of great fundraising ideas that are sure to be fun and get people engaged in your charitable cause. Sometimes there are national monthly themes, while other times there are holidays that could inspire a particular fundraiser. All four seasons lend themselves to certain types of fundraising events as well, so no matter what month of the year it is there is always something to fit the occasion. With that said, here are three seasonal fundraisers for every month of the year.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>January</strong><br />
         Calendars - It's the start of the New Year, so it's the perfect time to create a calendar and sell them to raise money for your cause. Pick a theme that makes sense for your charity, or you could go with a theme that lots of people would like. Cute animals or beautiful scenery can turn into big sellers. Or if you want to go with a more adult theme, bikini babes or shirtless firemen can work out too.
         <br /><br />
         Snow Shovelling - In January winter is in full swing and that means a lot of people have to shovel their driveways and walkways, sometimes on a daily basis. An easy fundraiser for this month is to simply go door to door asking to shovel the snow for a modest fee. Be sure to explain that it's for a good cause.
         <br /><br />
         Hot Drinks - Who doesn't like a cup of hot cocoa, cider, or tea on a chilly winter day? Set up a booth at a park with tobogganing hill, or at a skating rink, and sell the hot refreshments for a $1 each. The materials are cheap, and the drinks practically sell themselves.
         <br /><br />
      </div>
   </div>
   <div class="row">

      <div class="col-md-7">
         <strong>February</strong><br />
         Flowers and Chocolates - Love is in the air this month! Valentine's Day is on everyone's mind in February, so they're going to be thinking of what they can do for that special someone in their lives. Sell flowers or chocolates at local shopping malls, or go door to door. Maybe even throw in a romantic card as an added bonus.
         <br /><br />
         Singing Telegrams - If you have a good singing voice, or if you know someone else who does, you can offer to do singing telegrams for people. It's an old fashioned thing, but some people find it charming and thoughtful.
         <br /><br />
         Superbowl Fundrasier - February is also Superbowl time, and that means football fans will go all out throwing parties for the big game. Set up your own event and sell snacks and drinks, or ask a local sports bar if they'll let you use their establishment to throw a Superbowl party.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>March</strong><br />
         St. Paddy's Day Party - There's a little Irish in everyone on St. Patrick's Day, so this is a good opportunity to throw a St. Paddy's themed event. Sell pints of green beer, charge people to kiss the blarney stone, pop green balloons for prizes, and people to leave donations in a pot of gold. Mark March 17 on your calendar!
         <br /><br />
         National Nutrition Month - March is National Nutrition Month, so it's a good time to have a fundraiser based around healthy foods. You could have a healthy food bake sale, or have an eating competition where the contestants don't eat hotdogs but stuff their faces with salad instead.
         <br /><br />
         Used Book Drive - March is also National Reading Month, so you can take advantage of that theme by organizing a used book sale. Ask around and see if anyone has any old books they wouldn't mind parting with, and then sell them off for a couple bucks each.

      <div class="col-md-12">

         <strong>April</strong><br />
         Spring Cleaning - In April spring has arrived at last, and that means it's time for spring cleaning. Offer your expert cleaning services at a competitive price and you'll have people beating down the door to have you make their place spotless. Go door to door, or launch a social media campaign telling people about your spring cleaning fundraiser.
         <br /><br />
         CFL Bulbs for Earth Day - April 22 is Earth Day, a time when we are all encouraged to think about our impact on the environment and what we can do to reduce pollution in our own way. An easy thing that we can all do is replace the incandescent light bulbs in our house with low-wattage CFL bulbs. Acquire a large number of the bulbs wholesale, and sell them at a good price. You'll be raising money, and helping people reduce their carbon footprints as well as their electricity bills.
         <br /><br />
         Easter Egg Hunt - Of course Easter is also in April, and with Easter comes chocolate eggs and bunnies. Plants chocolate eggs around the neighbourhood and charge people a small fee for a document with clues on how to find them. Or, you could have an egg painting competition. All you need are eggs from the grocery store and some water colour paints to make it happen.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>May</strong><br />
         Cinco de Mayo - May 5 is Mexico's well known holiday Cinco de Mayo. On this special day organize a Mexican themed event with tacos, tequila, and Mariachi bands. There's something irresistibly fun about Mexican culture so this is one fundraiser that is sure to be a good time for everyone.
         <br /><br />
         Mothers Day Gifts - Mother's day also happens on the second Sunday of May, so this is another occasion where you can sell cards and gifts for people to give their moms. Check our product listings for things that could be easy to sell on this special day.
         <br /><br />
         Cut The Grass - Now that spring is here and the flowers are in bloom, it also means the grass is growing and people are bringing their lawnmowers out of the garage. Just like how you could go door to door shoveling driveways, you can go door to door offering to mow people's lawns.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>June</strong><br />
         Father's Day Gifts - Father's Day falls on the second Sunday in June, so just like with Mother's Day you can see this as an opportunity to launch a fundraiser. Check our product listings for things that can make good gifts for dear ol' dad!
         <br /><br />
         Neighbourhood Cleanup - World Environment Day is UN-led event that happens in June. This occasion is all about spreading awareness about what we can do to save the environment, so it can be a good time to do an environmental cleanup as a fundraiser. Look for people who will sponsor you to clean up a local park or neighbourhood.
         <br /><br />
         Summer BBQ - Nothings says summer like a barbeque on a hot, sunny day! Stage a community BBQ in a park and charge people for drinks, hot dogs, sausages, salads, and whatever you might want to bring to a barbeque. Jazz it up with some music and games like Frisbee or soccer and you'll be sure to get people interested in what you're doing.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>July</strong><br />
         Fireworks Display - Independence Day is always a cause for celebration and lots of people love a good fireworks display, so this is another occasion where you can launch a fundraiser. Hire professionals to set up a fireworks display and charge guests a modest admission fee to see the show. You can also sell snacks and refreshments for additional revenue streams.
         <br /><br />
         Massages - International Massage Week is in July as well, so if you're good with your hands you can offer people massages for a reasonable price. Help people loosen up and relax, and they'll be glad to donate to your fundraising cause.
         <br /><br />
         Ice Cream - July is also National Ice Cream Month, and what better time to indulge your sweet tooth than with some frosty treats in the summer sun? Look into finding large quantities of ice cream wholesale and sell them somewhere many people visit on foot. You might have the best results if you go to an area with a lot of tourists.

         <br /><br />
         <strong>August</strong><br />
         Refreshing Smoothies - August is when a lot of delicious berries and fruits are in season, so you can take advantage of the fresh harvest by mixing delicious smoothies for people. Set up a booth somewhere with a lot of foot traffic just like with the ice cream fundraiser in July.
         <br /><br />
         Artwork Drive - August is also Artist Appreciation Month, and this lends itself to a fundraising idea too. Stage an artwork auction, or hire an artist to draw portraits of people on the spot in a place with a lot of foot traffic.
         <br /><br />
         Piece of Pie - There are also numerous pie-themed days in August because so many fruits are in season at this time. Look into buying bulk quantities of various pies, or bake your own and sell slices at a booth on the street, or take orders from people and deliver the pies straight to their door.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>September</strong><br />
         Marathons - The month of September usually has a lot of marathons going on, and they are always good opportunities for fundraisers. Look for people to sponsor you to participate in a marathon, or maybe create your own marathon and charge people a registration fee.
         <br /><br />
         Wilderness Tours - September is National Wilderness Month, so if your city has a lot of natural beauty and wildlife you can arrange a wilderness tour group. Charge people a modest fee for a two or three walk in the woods and educate them on the many types of flora and fauna along the way.
         <br /><br />
         Back To School Special - Every kid knows that September means it's time to go back to school, and this occasion easily lends itself to raising funds. Order some of our pens and pencils and sell them to students or to parents with kids going back to class.

         <strong>October</strong><br />
         Pumpkin Carving - You know its October when every grocery store in town starts stocking massive quantities of pumpkins, and few things say Halloween better than a jack-o-lantern. Pick up some of those fresh pumpkins and charge people to enter into a pumpkin carving contest. When that's over, charge people to smash the pumpkins with a baseball bat!
         <br /><br />
         Candy Sales - Of course Halloween also means candy, and we've got all kinds of sweets to fit the occasion. These goodies practically sell themselves!
         <br /><br />
         Breast Cancer Drive - October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, so you can spread awareness about it and raise money if it makes sense for your charitable cause. Launch a donation drive, or simply go door to door asking for donations.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>November</strong><br />
         World Series Party - The baseball season is long and in November it all comes to a climax with the World Series. Just like the Superbowl, this is a great occasion to throw a themed party.
         <br /><br />
         Raking Leaves - Just like shoveling snow in January, and cutting the grass in May, November is a time when you can go door to door offering to rake and bag all the leaves littering people's lawns. All you need is a rake, a pair of gardening gloves, and the brown paper leaf bags. All that can easily be found at your local hardware store.
         <br /><br />
         Men's Health Awareness Drive - You've probably seen a lot of guys sporting moustaches for Movemeber to raise awareness for men's health, particularly for prostate cancer. If it goes with your fundraising cause, you can launch a fundraising drive for this monthly theme as well.
         <br /><br />

   <div class="row">

      <div class="col-md-7">
         <strong>December</strong><br />
         Pictures with Santa Claus - Kids love Santa Claus and some will line up down the block to sit on his knee and tell them what they want to for Christmas. Rent a Santa suit and set up a stage at a mall, or maybe in a local park, and change people a small fee to enter into Santa's workshop and tell jolly old St. Nick what they want this year. You'll need to hire a few elves and spare no expense on decorating the set to make it feel as Chistmasy as possible.
         <br /><br />
         Caroling - Dust off your holiday hymn books and warm up those vocal cords! It's time to spread some holiday cheer with a little door to door caroling. Once you instill the Christmas spirit in people with your beautiful voice they'll have no choice to but to donate some money to your fundraiser.
         <br /><br />
         Christmas Decor - What's a Christmas tree without ornaments to hang on it? If you're the crafty type you can make your own decorations and then sell them to the public. Or you can look into buying Christmas decor wholesale and selling them with a markup. Either way, you'll be helping people get a little more festive while generating some income for your fundraising cause.

         <br /><br />
         <strong>Ideas for Schools</strong>
         <ul>
            <li><i>"Pie the Teacher"</i> (or principal, or other authority figure): Kids can pay for a chance to pie an authority figure. You can also turn it into a raffle. The winning ticket-holder gets to pie the principal!</li>
            <li><i>Classroom Competition:</i> For school-wide fundraising, create competition between classrooms to boost participation. The classroom that sells or raises the most wins a prize like a pizza party or homework-free week.</li>
            <li><i>Friday Snack Shop:</i> As a special Friday treat, and on-going fundraising campaign, organize a snack shop that will be open every Friday during scheduled break times. Students and teachers can take turns running the shop, and you can sell treats like lollipops, candy bars, bags of chips or healthy beef snacks.</li>
         </ul>

         <strong>Ideas for Sports Teams and Leagues</strong>
         <ul>
            <li><i>Registration Day Fundraising:</i> Raise funds in one day by charging a fundraising fee. Team members and/or parents pay the fee on registration day and receive a Scratchcard that they can use to raise back their money, and even some extra to cover additional travel or equipment expenses. </li>
            <li><i>Customized Fundraisers:</i> Use your team's name, logo and colors to add an official touch to your campaign by choosing products and programs that can be customized such as - Scratchcards and the Free Online Magazine Fundraiser.</li>
            <li><i>Game Day Hotdog Sale:</i> A hotdog sale is a great fundraising idea because hotdogs are a low-cost snack that you know will sell fast. It's also pretty easy to find parent volunteers willing to man the barbecue and sell hotdogs throughout the game.</li>
         </ul>
         <strong>Ideas for Churches and Youth Groups</strong>
         <ul>
            <li><i>Holiday Sales:</i> Set up a sale of baked goods and holiday handicrafts made by members of the community just before the holidays. You can also take orders for frozen cheesecakes or cookie dough at your sale. Frozen foods are so convenient for the holidays, and your customers will really appreciate the opportunity to order these delectable treats.</li>
            <li><i>Strawberry Social:</i> You can use strawberries, apples, pumpkins, or any other in-season produce. Sell tickets for your social and have community members bake a variety of treats using your theme fruit. You can even have a bake-off as your main event!</li>
            <li><i>Talent Show:</i> What talents are hidden away in your community? Between churches and youth groups, there is probably a wealth of talent with little opportunity for exposure. Take advantage and organize a talent show filled with singing, dancing, acting, comedy and music all from local talent!</li>
         </ul>

         A well crafted and delivered survey can do a lot to improve your fundraising efforts. If you target the right demographics, and ask the right questions, you can gain some very helpful information that will enable you to take your fundraiser to the next level. Here's a quick rundown of how you can benefit from sending a survey to your supporters, and a few tips on how to make an effective one.<br />
         <br />
         <strong>How Surveys Help</strong>
         <br />
         A good survey takes time to put together, distribute, collect, and then compile all the data, but it will be worth the effort if you do it right. A good survey can help you improve your fundraiser in a specific way. For example, you might want to know how to sell more merchandise to your supporters, or how to attract more volunteers to help you out. You can also learn about how effective your fundraising efforts have been so far, and discover areas of improvement which, until then, maybe you had not considered before. So how can you go about designing an effective survey? There are many things to consider, but here are some quick tips to get you started.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>Effective Fundraising Survey Tips</strong>
         <ul>
            <li>Keep questions clear and concise - Your supporters probably aren't going to want to spend too much time filling out your survey, so that's why it's important to keep your questions short and to the point. Avoid using double negatives, and keep your questions open-ended (meaning, they'll have give an explanation rather than a simple yes or no).</li>
            <li>Use the Likert-Scale - Not all of your questions have to be open-ended though. You can also have a series of questions on the Likert-scale, which is where people rate their answer on a scale from "very unsatisfied" to "very satisfied". You should also include "not applicable" or "I don't know" as options.</li>
            <li>Keep it anonymous - People will be more willing to take the time to fill out the survey if they don't have to submit their personal information. You should also be sure to tell them at the start of the survey how long it will take, and wait until the end to ask for demographic info.</li>
            <li>Test it out - Before you send your survey to anyone, you should test it out and get feedback. You can do this by sending it to a small group of volunteers , or maybe you could give it to your friends and neighbours to see what they think. Just be sure they keep it confidential and don't tell anyone else about the survey.</li>
         </ul>
         These are just a few tips, but if you want to know more check out <a href="https://charityvillage.com/Content.aspx?topic=Survey_Says_Using_surveys_to_improve_strategic_decision_making#.WHOiC7YrLzV" target="blank">this post on Charity Village</a>.

         Getting kids involved with fundraising is a great way to teach them the value of getting involved with the community and making a difference. When it comes to <strong>fundraisers for kids</strong>, they need to be straightforward, safe, and fun. If you're stumped for suitable ideas, we've got a few that you could consider.
         <br /><br />
         Every kid needs pens and pencils for school, so a smelly pencils fundraiser is a great <strong>fundraising idea for kids</strong> Choose from our selection of <a href="/products/snifty" title="snifty fundraising idea">Snifty pens, pencils, and rulers</a> and simply have them sell them at school to their classmates.

         You can always take a more traditional approach by considering some of our candies and chocolate bars. Who doesn't have a sweet tooth? Choose from <a href="/products/lollipops" title="lollipop fundraising idea">lollipops</a>, <a href="/products/chocolate" title="chocolate bars fundraising idea">chocolate bars</a> <a href="/products/pretzel-rods" title="pretzel rods fundraising idea">pretzel rods</a> and more. These items should be an easy sell for the kids at school.
         <br /><br />
         Kids will love a colouring wall and it's really simple. All you have to do is choose a theme that a lot of kids will be interested in, or maybe something seasonal, and then find a lot of stencils on that theme. Charge a small fee, maybe just a dollar, to buy one of the stencils and supply them with the things they need to colour them in. Once they're done they can post on the colouring wall for everyone to see. Make sure they sign their names so everyone can recognize their work.
         <br /><br />
         These are just a couple fundraising ideas for kids that can fit the bill. Whatever you choose to do remember to keep it simple and safe for the young ones involved!

         When it comes to <strong>fundraisers for college students</strong>, the possibilities are virtually endless. If you're going to do this, you'll first have to organize a committee and assign each member specific tasks suitable to their individual talents and experience. Remember that students are usually busy with their studies, and they probably don't have a lot of money to spend, so you have to make sure your fundraiser is something that they would be interested in.
         <br /><br />
         An outdoor barbeque is always a popular choice. You'll need to rent the necessary equipment such as a barbeque (of course) and maybe also a tent and some tables to set everything up. Look into buying hot dogs and drinks in bulk because you're likely going to need a lot of them and anything you can do to keep costs down is going to help your fundraising profit margin. Get the word out that you're having a BBQ fundraiser via email, social media and flyers posted on campus well before the day of the event to make sure every knows about it.

      <div class="col-sm-12">
         <br />
         A dance party is another solid <strong>college fundraiser</strong>. See if you can host a dance in the school gym and look into hiring a DJ, or maybe some local bands, to provide entertainment. Of course you'll also have to provide food and drinks for your guests, and that is another way to generate some revenue on top of ticket sales. Just like with the BBQ idea, get the word out well before the event to ensure that people know about it.
         <br /><br />
         A lot of college students love to play sports, so a tournament is another great idea. It should also be easy to organize because the school will already have its own sport facilities. You'll have to reserve usage of the facility, and then organize the teams. Charge a modest fee to join the tournament and offer a prize to the winning team. Remind them that it is all for a good cause, and not necessarily about being the best athlete in school.
         <br /><br />
         Just remember to keep it fun, and focus on things that students are interested in!

            5 Movember Fundraising Ideas

         In the month of November many men grow mustaches for the cause of "Movember." In case you haven't heard of it, it's a men's health awareness campaign that takes places over the entire month of November. Prostate and testicular cancer are the two main health issues that it concerns itself with, and every year millions of dollars are raised for research into curing these deadly diseases.
         <br /><br />
         Themed occasions like this always lend themselves to fundraising ideas, so what can you do to get on board with Movember with your fundraising efforts? Here are a few @Html.ActionLink("Movember fundraisers", "Movember", "Promotion") to get you started off.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>Shave the Date</strong><br />
         Movember is all about growing a mustache to support awareness for men's health issues, and people who want to participate in the month-long event should start from scratch. That means shaving off what hair they already have on their faces, and growing a brand new mustache over the course of the month. Host a Shave the Date party and get everyone pumped up about Movember.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>Make a Video</strong><br />
         Make a promotional video about how your fundraising team is supporting Movember, and ask people to show their support by visiting your fundraising page and sending donations. Be sure to share your video over social media and ask your supporters to share with their networks too. The more who see it, the merrier!
         <br /><br />
         <strong>Sponsor Your Mustache</strong><br />
         If you're growing a mustache for Movember, it presents a great opportunity to find people to sponsor what you're doing. Ask your family, friends, and coworkers to pledge their money in the spirit of Movember, and in exchange you'll abandon the razor until no earlier than the 1st of December. If a lot of people on your fundraising team are going to do this, you can make a friendly contest out of it and offer a prize to the one who earns the most pledges.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>Movember Scratchcards</strong><br />
         This special month presents a great occasion for a @Html.ActionLink("scratchcards fundraiser", "scratchcards", "products"). With these scratchcards, the person scratching them doesn't win anything, but instead the cards tell them how much they're going to donate to your fundraiser. Customized cards with a fun Movember design can be an easy way to show support for men's health issues.
         <br /><br />
         <strong>Custom T-Shirts</strong><br />
         Allow people to show their support for Movember with @Html.ActionLink("custom T-shirts", "t-shirts/all-t-shirts/Custom-Tshirts", "products") designed for this special month. Think of T-shirts with a big mustache, and a clever or funny slogan, and you'll give people another easy way to show their support for men's health issues. You can design it yourself or ask our Fundraising consultants for help, and here's our piece: No extra charge!
         <br /><br />
         Don't forget to stop by our @Html.ActionLink("Movember page", "Movember", "Promotion") to get your Movember Fundraising Handbook and other free downloadables to kick-start your fundraiser!

                     CONSEJOS DE MARKETING PARA SU RECAUDACI&Oacute;N DE FONDOS

            El marketing es un elemento esencial de la recaudaci&oacute;n de fondos con el que algunas personas podr&iacute;an tener problemas. Podr&iacute;a recaudar dinero por una causa muy importante, pero las personas necesitan saber qu&eacute; est&aacute; haciendo y deben saber qu&eacute; impacto tendr&aacute;n sus donaciones. La direcci&oacute;n que tome depender&aacute; de la naturaleza de su organizaci&oacute;n ben&eacute;fica y los datos demogr&aacute;ficos a los que se dirige, pero para las organizaciones sin fines de lucro locales hay algunos consejos generales r&aacute;pidos que facilitan las cosas.

            <strong>Crea una lista de correo electr&oacute;nico</strong>
            <br />
            El email marketing es un m&eacute;todo de marketing muy poderoso, especialmente para la recaudaci&oacute;n de fondos. La mejor manera de construir su lista de correo electr&oacute;nico es utilizar la participaci&oacute;n de las redes sociales para dirigir a las personas al sitio web de recaudaci&oacute;n de fondos y solicitarles que se registren para recibir el bolet&iacute;n informativo. Cada nuevo suscriptor podr&iacute;a convertirse en donante en el futuro.
            <br /> <br />
            <strong>Cuente historias de impacto</strong><br />
            En todo su contenido, ya sea en el bolet&iacute;n informativo, en el sitio web o en las redes sociales, las historias de impacto son una mina de oro. Busque historias personales que demuestren c&oacute;mo su caridad ha marcado la diferencia. Testimonios, videos, infograf&iacute;as y entrevistas son todos formatos posibles para contar la historia. Cuando las personas vean la diferencia que realmente ha hecho su caridad, se les puede persuadir para que env&iacute;en una donaci&oacute;n.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Mantenga un concurso divertido</strong>
            <br />
            Una buena manera de generar algo de inter&eacute;s para su recaudaci&oacute;n de fondos es mediante la celebraci&oacute;n de un concurso a trav&eacute;s de las redes sociales. Por ejemplo, si tiene una organizaci&oacute;n ben&eacute;fica de deportes, puede solicitar a las personas que env&iacute;en sus mejores fotos de las peque&ntilde;as ligas, y las tres mejores recibir&aacute;n un premio. Ese es solo un ejemplo, pero el concurso que elijas ejecutar debe ser algo relacionado con tu causa. &#33;De esa manera puede proporcionar una transici&oacute;n f&aacute;cil a su recaudaci&oacute;n de fondos donde puede solicitar donaciones con una historia de impacto convincente!

               UNA FORMA CLARA DE DUPLICAR LAS GANANCIAS
            </h1>

            Las recaudaciones de fondo de lavado de autos dependen de los clientes que hacen fila para que le limpien su veh&iacute;culo, pero &iquest;existe otra forma en la que pueda aumentar a&uacute;n m&aacute;s sus ganancias? Por supuesto, y la oportunidad ser&aacute; "perfectamente clara" para usted en un momento.
            <br /><br />
            Cada gran recaudaci&oacute;n de fondos depende de factores clave de &eacute;xito. El primero es cu&aacute;ntos clientes puedes atraer. Eso a veces es un poco dif&iacute;cil de prever con un lavado de autos, as&iacute; que mant&eacute;n los dedos cruzados esperando que los prospectos creen una l&iacute;nea que se extienda en el horizonte.
            <br /><br />
            Una segunda v&iacute;a para el &eacute;xito de la recaudaci&oacute;n de fondos es la cantidad de contribuci&oacute;n que puede generar de cada patrocinador individual. Cuanto m&aacute;s, mejor, el patrocinador ya est&aacute; contribuyendo, pero siempre puedes sacar m&aacute;s provecho sobre esta oportunidad, ya que puedes influir en ellos y ofrecerles m&aacute;s cosas cuando lleguen al lugar.
            <br /><br />
            Aunque el encerado del auto o las ruedas con un cargo adicional es una estrategia, ofrecer una forma de mantener limpio el interior del veh&iacute;culo del acompa&ntilde;ante durante un largo tiempo despu&eacute;s de lavar el autom&oacute;vil podr&iacute;a ser bastante poderoso. Ahora est&aacute;s en algo.
            <br /><br />
            Usted ya sabe que a cada usuario le gusta la idea de mantener limpio su veh&iacute;culo. Pero si bien la pr&oacute;xima lluvia puede afectar el exterior, el interior es diferente. Representa el entorno en el que el conductor entra y vive cada d&iacute;a.
