"If I put an order in for 4 more cases of lollipops, is there any way you could overnight it so it would be here Friday?&nbsp; These kids at Washington Street School have already bought the 2 cases I ordered.&nbsp; Please let me know ASAP.&nbsp; Thank you so very much... they are a HUGE success."<br>

"We can hardly believe how fast beef jerky sells.&nbsp; Both the students and parents have continued to insist we carry this particular fund-raiser because it is so easy to move and the profit margin is great!"<br>
<div align=right><i>Lisa Shelton</i>, <b>East Lawrence HS</b></div>

"We are interested in starting the fund-raiser as soon as possible.&nbsp; We have used your brochure fund-raisers several times in the past with great results, and I am looking forward to much more of the same."<br>

"On behalf of my organization, the South Suburban Resource and Hunger Network, I thank you for all the assistance you provided in our first fund-raising efforts of selling cookie dough.&nbsp; The forms provided, the careful attention to details (and patience with me) and follow-up phone calls truly made this effort easy.&nbsp; The cookie dough arrived in a timely fashion, just as you promised.&nbsp; No tubs were broken and we are very happy.&nbsp; We look forward to doing another fund-raiser with you later on this year.&nbsp; You are to be commended on providing such excellent service.&nbsp; Thank you."<br>

"EZFund provided the service we expected based on the name of your company.&nbsp; The cookie dough fund-raiser was very easy, unlike previous years with other companies.&nbsp; Although I will be moving off the board, I plan to equip the members for next year with EZFund fund-raiser information."<br>
