<b>Hurricane Ike Update:</b><p>

First, we would like to thank everyone for their patience during these trying times.<p> 

As of 8:30 pm Monday night (9/15), we are fully operational and ready to handle all of your 
fundraising needs. Our WEB site and phones are now up. In fact we started shipping product 
again Monday afternoon!<p>

EZfund.com and our employees weathered Hurricane Ike quite well. We did not have physical 
wind or water damage to our facility or product and we never lost power. Reports from our 
employees are just as good with most reporting just minor tree damage at their homes and 
a few are still without power.<p>

Unfortunately many of our friends, family, and business associates in southeast Texas did 
not fair so well, and to these people go our thoughts and prayers.<p>

Thanks again,<p>
