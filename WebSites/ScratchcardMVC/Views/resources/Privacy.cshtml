        1.	GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR PRIVACY PRACTICES
        <br /><br />
        Scratchcard.com is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of our users and maintaining a secure online environment for our online fundraising programs. Our Privacy Statement covers our World Wide Web sites found at:
        <a href="http://www.scratchcard.com" title="go to scratchcard.com" style="color:#940a03">http://www.scratchcard.com</a>.
        <br /><br />
        This Privacy Statement is effective as of the date written above and is designed to meet the following principles and practices:
        We fully disclose what information is collected on our sites and how we use that information;
        Campaign organizers, participants and supporters who participate in our online campaign programs may choose whether they want to continue to receive communications from us;
        We provide our registered campaign organizers with access to their account information and the ability to modify that information; and
        We are dedicated to creating a secure environment for user information and use an advanced network server security system to safeguard user information.
        In the more detailed description of our privacy practices below, when we use the term "you," we are referring to registered campaign organizers, participants, supporters and general users of our web sites who order campaign products or information from our web sites. When we use the term "personal information," we are referring to a user's first and last name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address. Scratchcard.com does not collect social security numbers.
        <br /><br />
        Violating our privacy policy is cause for termination of your campaign. In addition, Scratchcard.com Corporation reserves the right to cooperate with municipal, state and federal officials in any law-enforcement investigation requiring either personal information or reports about lawful or unlawful user activities on this site.

        Information Collected Through the Traditional Fundraising Programs
        <br /><br />
        We offer traditional campaign program products through Scratchcard.com. You may order free samples of products online, or request that a consultant contact you to take your campaign program order. You may also call our toll-free Order Desk to order your free samples. If you choose to submit orders or requests online, you will need to provide us with the necessary fulfillment information through our online order or request form. All personal information you submit to us through the Scratchcard.com will only be used by us and our third-party suppliers and transactional companies for the purpose of fulfilling your order or request. Scratchcard.com may contact you with informational updates and communications, which you may always opt-out of as described below.
        <br /><br />
        Information Collected Through Scratchcard.com's Online Fundraising System
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Registration Information</h4>
        In order to use our services, and/or to receive a free information kit, campaign organizers must complete an online registration form or call our toll-free number at 1-866-385-1128. When registering online or by phone, campaign organizers need to supply contact information, relevant affiliation(s), and details related to their fundraising campaign. We collect this information from fundraising campaign organizers to assess the organizer's fundraising needs and to respond to them with information relevant to their request.
        <br /><br />
        <h4>E-Mail Collection Forms</h4>
        In order to solicit supporters for your campaign, we provide campaign organizers with e-mail Collection Forms to distribute to campaign participants so that participants may collect potential campaign supporters' e-mail addresses. The participants then return these e-mail collection forms to the campaign organizer to be entered into the online campaign database, or, if the participant is age 13 or over, the participant may register through the Scratchcard.com's web site and enter the e-mail collection form directly into their online campaign database. We use the e-mail addresses of the individuals listed on the e-mail Collection Form for the sole purpose of inviting potential supporters to visit that organizer's specific fundraising Web page and to purchase products to support that fundraising campaign.
        <br /><br />
        III. SPECIFIC INFORMATION PRACTICES FOR ALL Scratchcard.com SITES
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Order Information</h4>
        To purchase or order sample campaign products through any of our sites, you will need to provide order information (which may include credit card information). If you are purchasing campaign products from us, once your credit card has been approved by our third-party transactional company for the amount equaling the total of the supporter's desired purchases, the third-party supplier(s) will receive all relevant purchase details (item description, quantity, etc.) needed to fulfill the order. All personal information collected during the ordering process is used solely for order processing, billing and shipping.
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Information Sharing</h4>
        As detailed above, Scratchcard.com Corporation does not give your personal information to third parties not associated with our campaign products or services. Our third-party suppliers use a variety of external delivery companies to ship orders, and a third-party firm processes the campaign supporters' credit cards for goods purchased. These companies, by contractual agreement with us, are not permitted to retain, store or use personally identifiable customer information except for order processing and fulfillment.

        <br /><br />
        <h4>E-Mail Restrictions</h4>
