Hi [Supporter_Name],

2. Choose your favorite magazine(s) or renew any of your existing subscription(s). 

Remember, you can renew the subscription(s) to any of your current magazines at any time.  You will NOT lose any of the remaining months on your current subscription.  A renewal subscription simply adds the additional months onto your current subscription.

3. Pay by credit card or if you prefer, wait for your invoice in the mail.

For each magazine purchased or renewed, The [Group_Name] receives 40% of paid subscriptions!  Your support is very appreciated!

Thanks you!

P.S. There are over 600 magazines to choose from and you will save up to 85% off newsstand prices.
